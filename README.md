# VULCAN -- ParsePort

This is a fork of the original VULCAN, developed and maintained by [Jonas Groschwitz (jgroschwitz)](https://github.com/jgroschwitz). Please refer to the [original repo](https://github.com/jgroschwitz/vulcan) for the original documentation, including setup and usage instructions.

This fork adapts VULCAN to be used within the ParsePort project as a visualization tool for linguistic parses made by the Minimalist Parser developed by [Meaghan Fowlie (megodoonch)](https://github.com/megodoonch) at Utrecht University. More documentation on ParsePort, developed at the Centre For Digital Humanities at Utrecht University, can be found [here](https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities/parseport).

More information will be added in the future.
